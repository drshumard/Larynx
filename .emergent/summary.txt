<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a full-stack application named Larynx TTS. The core functionality involves converting long text into a single MP3 file using the ElevenLabs TTS API. The application should feature a sophisticated frontend for job submission and a dashboard for monitoring job progress and details. The project has evolved through several iterations, with the user providing detailed feedback on UI/UX, moving from a glassmorphism style to a professional enterprise SaaS aesthetic.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Core Functionality:** Accept text and generate a single audio file.
2.  **Dual-Mode TTS:** The application must support two methods for audio generation, selectable via a universal setting:
    *   **Chunking Mode:** Manually split long text, process each chunk via the ElevenLabs TTS API (), and concatenate the resulting audio files.
    *   **Studio Mode:** Use the ElevenLabs Studio API () to process long-form content in a single project-based workflow, which handles chunking automatically.
3.  **Frontend UI:**
    *   An enterprise-grade SaaS interface for submitting and monitoring jobs.
    *   A dashboard to display all jobs with their status.
    *   A dedicated job details page for each job, accessible via SPA routing.
    *   The details page must show the full configuration used for the job, including the TTS mode.
    *   For jobs created in Chunking mode, the page must display the full API request for each chunk and provide an individual audio player for each chunk's output.
4.  **Persistent Settings:**
    *   A settings modal that allows the user to configure TTS parameters for both Chunking and Studio modes.
    *   These settings must be saved persistently in the database and applied to all subsequent jobs.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack FARM (FastAPI, React, MongoDB) application is in place. The backend supports two distinct TTS generation modes: the original Chunking mode and the newly implemented Studio mode. The active mode is determined by a persistent setting in the MongoDB database.

The frontend is a React Single-Page Application (SPA) with an enterprise-grade SaaS design. It features a main dashboard for job overview and a separate, route-based page for detailed job inspection. A comprehensive settings modal allows the user to switch between Chunking and Studio modes and configure all relevant parameters for each.

**Last working item**:
The agent was implementing the Studio Mode feature as an alternative to the existing Chunking workflow.

- **Last item agent was working:** The agent has completed the implementation of the Studio Mode. This included backend changes to add a new processing pipeline using the ElevenLabs Studio API and frontend updates to the settings modal to include a Studio tab with the relevant configuration options. The agent successfully updated the settings to use Studio mode.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** manual testing. The agent needs to create a new job while Studio mode is active and verify the entire end-to-end process. This involves checking backend logs, monitoring job status in the database/UI, and confirming the final audio output.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1:** (P0) Test and Verify Studio Mode End-to-End Functionality.

  **Issues Detail:**
  - **Issue 1:** Test and Verify Studio Mode End-to-End Functionality.
     - **Attempted fixes:** The agent has written all the necessary backend logic ( function) and frontend UI components (Studio settings tab). The settings have been successfully saved with . However, the actual creation of a job in this mode has not been attempted.
     - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Create a new job using the frontend Create Job form.
        2.  Immediately monitor the backend logs (==> /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log <==

        3.  Check the job's status on the UI dashboard. It should transition through states like , , and finally .
        4.  If the job fails, inspect the backend logs for HTTP error codes (e.g., 422) from the ElevenLabs Studio API and analyze the error response.
        5.  Once the job is complete, navigate to the job details page and verify that the final audio can be played and downloaded.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will validate that the user's latest and most complex feature request is fully functional, completing the dual-mode TTS system.
     - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?** N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
     - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
There are no other tasks in progress. The entire focus is on validating the new Studio Mode feature.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no further tasks requested by the user at this time.

**Completed work in this session**
- **UI Redesign:** Iteratively redesigned the entire frontend to an Enterprise SaaS aesthetic based on detailed user specifications.
- **Job Detail Page:** Implemented a new SPA page () for detailed job inspection, moving away from a modal-based view.
- **Per-Chunk Audio Players:** Added the ability to store and play audio for individual text chunks on the job details page.
- **Persistent Settings Modal:** Created a settings modal to configure TTS parameters, which are saved in the database.
- **ElevenLabs Studio Mode Integration:** Researched and implemented a new backend workflow using the ElevenLabs Studio API. This includes:
  - New API logic in  to create and convert Studio projects.
  - A new Studio tab in the frontend settings modal with specific configuration options.
  - A universal mode selector in settings to switch between Chunking and Studio modes.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Motor (async MongoDB driver),  background tasks,  for REST API calls to the Studio API, ElevenLabs Python SDK for the Chunking API.
- **Frontend:** React, hooks, Axios,  for SPA navigation.
- **Dual-Mode Architecture:** The application is architected to support two distinct TTS processing pipelines, selectable via a single setting.

**key DB schema**
-   **collection**: 
    -   **document structure**:

    -   **document structure**: 

**changes in tech stack**
-    was added to the frontend to enable Single-Page Application (SPA) routing.
-   The backend now uses the  library for direct REST API communication with the ElevenLabs Studio endpoints.

**All files of reference**
-   : Significantly updated to handle the dual-mode logic, new database models for settings, and the -based Studio API calls.
-   : Significantly updated to implement SPA routing with  and the new tabbed settings modal with conditional UI for Chunking vs. Studio modes.
-   : Updated with new styles for the mode selector tabs and other UI enhancements.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-    is now extremely large and monolithic. It contains the logic for the entire application, including routing, multiple pages (Dashboard, Job Details), and complex components (Settings Modal). This file should be broken down into a proper React project structure with separate files for pages, components, and hooks to improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Creates a new job, now dynamically uses either the Chunking or Studio processing function based on the active mode setting.
-   : Retrieves full job details.
-   : Serves audio for an individual chunk (Chunking mode only).
-   : Retrieves the current TTS settings, including the active mode.
-   : Updates the TTS settings.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The application now operates in one of two modes: Chunking or Studio. The active mode is a universal setting stored in the database.
- Your immediate and highest-priority task is to test the end-to-end functionality of the newly implemented Studio mode. The code is in place, but it has not been verified by an actual job run.
- Be aware that the frontend code in  is monolithic. While it is functional, exercise caution when making changes. A future refactor to componentize the application would be beneficial.

**documents and test reports created in this job**

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  : can you add a player for all the chunks as wells in the job details so I can play every audio from every chunk
2.  : currently we have the tts settings, you're going to add another request flow for the elevenlabs studio.. which means i can switch between the chunking which is this current setting with how it currently looks or studio, it can be a tab in the tts settings modal, chunking as one tab studio as another tab..
3.  : if you need information about elevenlabs studio api let me know
4.  : search for the latest ElevenLabs Studio API docs and the confirm with me before you implement
5.  : 1. i want mode selector on settings modal because most of the jobs will come from an API not from the front end. so the settings modal needs to be applied universally. 2. yes same voice_id .. can i control speed of the generation? 3. i dont want to use any llm content generation but i want control so project api it is
6.  : Implement

The user has not sent any messages since approving the implementation plan for Studio mode. The next step is to test the implementation and report back.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The new Studio mode is implemented but unverified. It should be considered potentially broken until a successful end-to-end test is completed.
-   **Mocked:** No mocked data or services are in use.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **ElevenLabs API:** A user-provided API key is required. The application now interacts with two distinct parts of this API:
    -   **Text-to-Speech API ():** Used for Chunking mode.
    -   **Studio API ():** Used for Studio mode.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO (for the latest Studio feature).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None for the recent features.
-   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
The ElevenLabs API key is located in the  file.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has correctly implemented the code for the new Studio mode feature as requested. However, the final and most crucial step—testing the feature by creating a job—has not been performed. The agent stopped after confirming the settings were saved correctly, but before verifying the new processing pipeline.</analysis>
